# Getting Started with TensorFlow

This repository contains a collection of Tensorflow tutorials mainly written in Jupiter Notebooks. Please kindly note that this is being developed and I'm planning to discuss following topics. 

1. Introduction 
2. Regression Models
3. Introduction to Classification Models
4. Introduction to Neural Networks
5. Digit Classification using Deep Networks
6. Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks

```python
x, y = DataGenerator.linear(lambda x: 3*x + 5, 0, 10, sample_size=250, noise_mean=0, noise_var=5)
plt.scatter(x, y, s=25, color = '#c51b3a')
plt.show()
```
